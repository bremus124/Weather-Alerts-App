# flaunting-pony-scorers
## Description:
We created an application in which a user can search a city using google maps and get a weather warning alert(s), if any, for the given area. These weather alerts can include heat advisory, air quality alert, thunderstorm, snow, etc. It can also show the severity of the alert such as a watch or warning. The recent cities will stay on the page and you can easily view what was previously searched. 

## User Story:
As a user I want to be alerted of any significant weather warnings within a geographical location at a given time.
